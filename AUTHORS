rOCCI was originally designed by Florian Feldhaus (GWDG) and Piotr Kasprzak
(GWDG) in Germany. The project is currently being developed by CESNET, mainly
for EGI Federated Cloud.

Special thanks goes to the following extraordinary individuals, without whom
rOCCI would not be possible:

* Hayati Bice      - who wrote the initial version of a server for rOCCI
* Max GÃ¼nther      - who wrote the EC2 backend
* Andre Thevapalan - for his input regarding the JSON rendering
* The OCCI WG      - for developing OCCI
